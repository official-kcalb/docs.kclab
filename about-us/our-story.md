# Our Story

[Kcalb Ltd](https://kcalb.org/) mission was born from the observation that the cryptocurrency space was not being fully utilised by diverse individuals and entrepreneurs due to challenge of accessibility and therefore trust.

With this in mind, the creation of an ecosystem began, to support members of the community and their initiatives but also to leverage the powerful **synergy** between **technology** and **creativity**.

By prioritising accessibility and **transparency,** the goal is to build a **user-friendly** and trusted environment that empowers everyone to reach their **fullest potential**.

With founders based on different continents, the initiative benefits from a **global perspective** to the needs for support, collaboration and communication.
