We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are temporary cookies that expire once you close your web browser. They are used to track your navigation on our site during a single visit. For example, they can remember the items you have placed in your cart while you browse different pages of our site.

Persistent cookies, on the other hand, remain on your device until you manually delete them or until they reach a defined expiration date. These cookies are used to remember your preferences and actions on our website for your future visits. For example, they can remember your login information so you don‚Äôt have to enter it each time you visit our site, or they can remember your language preferences.
